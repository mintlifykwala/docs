## Coming soon

These features are currently in active development and will be released in upcoming updates:

### Environment variables for secrets and keys

Securely manage API keys, private data, and sensitive information in your workflows without hardcoding them in your YAML files.

### Conditionals (if/else logic)

Add decision-making capabilities to your workflows with conditional execution paths based on runtime values, API responses, or blockchain state.

### Input forms for user-triggered workflows

Create custom input forms that allow users to provide parameters when manually triggering workflows, making your automations more interactive and flexible.

### Reusable components and template libraries

Build once, use everywhere. Create reusable workflow components and share them across your projects or with the community.

## Future initiatives
