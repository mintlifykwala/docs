---

Kwala follows a zero-trust, verifiable execution approach that builds security guarantees across its infrastructure. Every layer of the system implements specific security measures to protect user assets and ensure trustless execution.

## Security by layer

Kwala implements security measures at every architectural layer:

| Security layer | Measures |
|----------------|----------|
| **User layer** | Self-custody of keys, signed intents, non-repudiation |
| **Node layer** | Permissioned entry, KMS-backed keys, sandboxed execution, mTLS |
| **Workflow layer** | Immutable YAML intents, conditionally executable logic, execution logs |
| **Verifier layer** | Watchdog verification, proof-based dispute, slashing mechanism |
| **Infrastructure layer** | Distributed infra, autoscaling, rate-limiting, failover and redundancy |

## Core security measures

### Sandboxed execution

Workflows run in isolated environments that prevent unauthorized access to system resources or external entities.

- Each workflow executes in its own container
- No access to host filesystem or network outside defined actions
- Resource limits prevent denial-of-service attacks
- Execution environments are destroyed after completion

### Deterministic workflows

Workflows execute identically across all nodes, producing consistent, verifiable results regardless of the node processing them.

- Same inputs always produce same outputs
- No reliance on node-specific state or randomness
- Enables independent verification by any party
- Ensures fair and predictable execution

### Cryptographically signed actions

Every action is signed and logged, creating an immutable audit trail traceable to the original user intent.

```
┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│   User Intent   │────▶│   Node Action   │────▶│   On-Chain Log  │
│   (signed)      │     │   (signed)      │     │   (immutable)   │
└─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘
        │                       │                       │
        └───────────────────────┴───────────────────────┘
                    Cryptographic chain of custody
```

### Immutable workflow history

All executions are permanently recorded on the Kalp Chain to enable audits and verification. You can use intent hashes, execution logs, and reports to verify historical workflow executions.

| Record type | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| **Intent hashes** | Prove user authorization for specific workflows |
| **Execution logs** | Detail every action taken during execution |
| **Verifier reports** | Attest to correctness of execution |

### Independent verifier nodes

Lightweight validators recompute workflow logic and verify the correctness of executor actions and outputs.

- Operate independently from execution nodes
- Randomly assigned to prevent collusion
- File disputes when deviations detected
- Participate in slashing decisions

### Permissioned nodes with KMS-backed keys

All nodes are vetted through Kalp Governance, with private keys stored in non-extractable Key Management Systems that perform signing operations in hardware enclaves.

- Node operators cannot access raw private keys
- Signing happens inside hardware security modules
- Keys are bound to specific node identities
- Audit trails for all signing operations

### Encrypted inter-node communication

All node-to-node communication uses mutual TLS (mTLS) with node-specific certificates for authentication and encryption.

- TLS 1.3 encryption for all traffic
- Mutual authentication prevents impersonation
- Certificate-based node identity verification
- Protection against man-in-the-middle attacks

## User layer security

Users maintain complete control over their security:

## Infrastructure security

The Kwala infrastructure implements enterprise-grade security controls:

| Control | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| **Distributed infrastructure** | Nodes spread across multiple regions and providers |
| **Autoscaling** | Dynamic capacity to handle load spikes |
| **Rate limiting** | Protection against abuse and DoS attacks |
| **Failover and redundancy** | Automatic recovery from node failures |
| **Network isolation** | Segmented networks for different functions |
| **Monitoring and alerting** | Real-time detection of anomalies |
