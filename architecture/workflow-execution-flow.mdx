title: 'Workflow execution lifecycle'
description: 'How workflows are executed in Kwala'
---

Every Kwala workflow follows a structured execution lifecycle that ensures security, verifiability, and transparency. From the moment a user signs their workflow intent to the final verification by independent nodes, each step is designed to maintain trustless execution while providing a complete audit trail on the Kalp Chain.

## Execution steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="User-signed intent">
    The user defines a workflow in YAML and signs it using their self-custody wallet (such as MetaMask or Kalp Wallet). This signature proves ownership and creates a non-repudiable authorization. The signed workflow is submitted to the Kwala network and stored on Kalp Chain as an immutable record.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Trigger detection">
    Kwala nodes monitor on-chain events, price feeds, and time intervals across multiple blockchain networks. When a trigger condition is met, eligible nodes compete to claim the workflow execution. The first node to successfully claim the workflow begins the execution process.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="KVM processing">
    The claiming node's KVM parses and validates the workflow against the on-chain signed intent. It extracts event parameters using the `re.event(n)` syntax and prepares the action sequence for execution in a sandboxed environment.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Execution and proof generation">
    The node validates the signed intent, executes each action, and signs the outcome. The cross-chain action engine handles on-chain operations while the Web2 integration layer processes external API calls. All actions and results are logged in a verifiable proof format and committed to Kalp Chain.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verifier node audit">
    Independent verifier nodes check the execution log, YAML workflow, and original intent. They re-compute the workflow logic and compare results against the submitted proof. If a node deviates from the user's intent, it is slashed or blacklisted via on-chain governance, providing a permanent, auditable record.
