Kwala is a verifiable, event-driven Web3 workflow automation and backend platform. It allows developers to build automation-first, backend-less dApps using simple YAML-based workflows. Behind this no-code simplicity lies a secure, decentralized-yet-permissioned infrastructure powered by Kalp Network, designed to deliver production-grade automation, regulatory compliance, and trustless execution.

## Architecture overview

Kwala's architecture consists of interconnected components that work together to enable stateless, decentralized workflow execution:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Stateless automation layer** | Processes workflows off-chain while retaining cryptographic guarantees |
| **Kwala Virtual Machine (KVM)** | Deterministic runtime that interprets and executes workflow definitions |
| **Event trigger engine** | Monitors blockchain activity and detects workflow activation conditions |
| **Cross-chain action engine** | Executes on-chain operations across multiple networks |
| **Web2 integration layer** | Connects workflows to external APIs and enterprise systems |

## Stateless automation layer

Kwala shifts workflow logic off-chain while retaining cryptographic guarantees and verifiable execution on-chain. By separating automation logic from state transitions, Kwala enables scalable, cost-effective workflow execution without compromising decentralization.

The stateless automation layer processes workflows using four key components:

- **Deterministic workflow virtual machine**: Interprets workflow definitions consistently across all nodes
- **Decentralized task runners**: Execute workflows across a distributed network
- **Event-driven triggers**: Monitor blockchain activity for activation conditions
- **Cross-chain action executors**: Perform operations across multiple blockchain networks

## Kwala Virtual Machine (KVM)

The Kwala Virtual Machine (KVM) is the execution engine that interprets and processes workflow definitions. It functions as a deterministic runtime environment where YAML-based workflows are parsed, validated, and prepared for execution across the decentralized network.

### KVM capabilities

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **YAML parsing** | Parses workflow definitions for consistent interpretation across all nodes |
| **Event extraction** | Extracts event arguments using the `re.event(n)` syntax for simplified parameter access |
| **Workflow validation** | Validates workflow structure and logic before execution |
| **Trigger scheduling** | Schedules triggers based on defined conditions |
| **Sequence orchestration** | Orchestrates multi-step workflow sequences |
| **Web2 interactions** | Enables API calls and external service integrations |

This design allows workflows to run identically across every node in the decentralized execution network, maintaining consistency and reliability without requiring centralized coordination.

## Event trigger engine

The event trigger engine monitors blockchain activity across multiple networks, detecting state changes that initiate workflow execution.

### Supported trigger types

- **Smart contract events**: Listen for specific events emitted by contracts
- **Price changes**: React to token price movements (coming soon)
- **Time-based intervals**: Schedule automation using cron expressions
- **Webhook inputs**: Receive triggers from external systems
- **Wallet activity**: Monitor transactions and balance changes

### Simplified event parameter extraction

Extracting event parameters typically requires complex regex patterns and custom parsing logic. Kwala simplifies this with the `re.event(index)` syntax—a zero-configuration approach that extracts event parameters by their index position.

Instead of writing ABI parsing code or regex patterns, reference event data directly:

```yaml
Actions:
  - Name: forward_transfer
    Type: call
    TargetContract: 0x...
    TargetParams:
      - re.event(0)  # First parameter from the triggering event
      - re.event(2)  # Third parameter from the triggering event
```

## Cross-chain action engine

The cross-chain action engine executes on-chain operations in response to workflow triggers.

### Capabilities

- **Smart contract calls**: Initiate contract interactions on any supported blockchain
- **Token operations**: Process transfers, approvals, and swaps
- **Multi-network coordination**: Coordinate actions across multiple networks simultaneously
- **Multi-step pipelines**: Orchestrate complex sequences of operations

Developers define all operations in a single YAML file, eliminating the need for separate deployment scripts or custom coordination logic across different blockchain environments.

## Web2 integration layer

The Web2 integration layer enables workflows to interact with existing infrastructure, bridging the gap between blockchain operations and enterprise systems.

### Integration capabilities

| Integration | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **REST APIs** | Call any HTTP endpoint with custom headers and payloads |
| **Webhooks** | Trigger external services when workflow events occur |
| **Database queries** | Read from and write to external data sources |
| **Cloud functions** | Invoke serverless functions on AWS, GCP, or Azure |
| **External services** | Integrate with any service that exposes an API |

By providing native Web2 connectivity, Kwala removes a critical barrier to enterprise blockchain adoption at scale.

## Key architectural principles

### Permissioned decentralization

All Kwala nodes are permissioned and operate within a governed set of policies but are independently verifiable and distributed across geographies and entities. This hybrid approach combines the trust benefits of decentralization with the compliance requirements of enterprise applications.

### Verifiable automation

All workflow executions are traceable to a user-signed intent, and logs are publicly auditable on Kalp Chain. Every action taken by the network can be cryptographically verified against the original workflow definition.

### KMS-backed signing

Nodes sign transactions using private keys stored securely in Key Management Systems (KMS). These keys are not directly accessible even to the nodes themselves, providing an additional layer of security for automated transaction signing.

### Self-custody

Every user retains control over their private keys and signs automation workflows themselves. No custodial control is imposed by Kwala. Users authorize specific actions through signed intents, maintaining full sovereignty over their assets.
