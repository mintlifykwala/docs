Verifier nodes are lightweight, independently deployed actors responsible for ensuring fidelity of automation. They provide the trust layer that makes Kwala's decentralized execution verifiable and tamper-proof.

While execution nodes process workflows and perform actions, verifier nodes act as independent auditors. They ensure that every workflow execution adheres strictly to the user's signed intent and the defined workflow logic.

## Role of verifier nodes

Verifier nodes perform four primary functions in the Kwala network:

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Re-compute workflow logic** | Independently execute workflow logic based on the original user intent |
| **Compare outputs** | Compare actual output of executor nodes with expected outcome |
| **File disputes** | Submit disputes to Kalp Chain's arbitration contract in case of deviation |
| **Periodic auditing** | Run periodically or via randomly assigned rounds for high-value workflows |

## Verification process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Execution proof retrieval">
    Verifier nodes retrieve execution proofs submitted by executor nodes from Kalp Chain. These proofs contain all inputs, outputs, and state transitions from the workflow execution.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Intent reconstruction">
    The verifier retrieves the original user-signed workflow intent from the chain and reconstructs the expected execution path.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Independent re-computation">
    Using the same inputs and trigger data, the verifier independently re-computes the workflow logic to determine the expected outcome.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Result comparison">
    The verifier compares its computed result against the executor's submitted proof. Any discrepancy triggers the dispute process.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Dispute or attestation">
    If results match, the verifier attests to the execution validity. If results differ, the verifier files a dispute to the arbitration contract.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Security guarantees

Verifier nodes provide several security guarantees to the Kwala network:

- **Non-repudiation**: Users cannot deny their signed intents
- **Execution fidelity**: Executors cannot deviate from defined workflows
- **Transparency**: All verifications are recorded on-chain
- **Accountability**: Malicious actors face economic penalties
