Verifier nodes are lightweight, independently deployed actors responsible for ensuring fidelity of automation. They provide the trust layer that makes KWALA's decentralized execution verifiable and tamper-proof.

## Overview

While execution nodes process workflows and perform actions, verifier nodes act as independent auditors. They ensure that every workflow execution adheres strictly to the user's signed intent and the defined workflow logic.

## Role of verifier nodes

Verifier nodes perform four primary functions in the KWALA network:

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Re-compute workflow logic** | Independently execute workflow logic based on the original user intent |
| **Compare outputs** | Compare actual output of executor nodes with expected outcome |
| **File disputes** | Submit disputes to Kalp Chain's arbitration contract in case of deviation |
| **Periodic auditing** | Run periodically or via randomly assigned rounds for high-value workflows |

## Verification process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Execution proof retrieval">
    Verifier nodes retrieve execution proofs submitted by executor nodes from Kalp Chain. These proofs contain all inputs, outputs, and state transitions from the workflow execution.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Intent reconstruction">
    The verifier retrieves the original user-signed workflow intent from the chain and reconstructs the expected execution path.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Independent re-computation">
    Using the same inputs and trigger data, the verifier independently re-computes the workflow logic to determine the expected outcome.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Result comparison">
    The verifier compares its computed result against the executor's submitted proof. Any discrepancy triggers the dispute process.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Dispute or attestation">
    If results match, the verifier attests to the execution validity. If results differ, the verifier files a dispute to the arbitration contract.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Verification modes

Verifier nodes operate in different modes depending on workflow requirements:

### Periodic verification

Verifiers run on scheduled intervals to audit a sample of recent executions. This provides continuous coverage without requiring verification of every single execution.

### Random assignment

For high-value workflows, verifiers are randomly assigned to specific executions. This randomization prevents collusion between executors and verifiers.

### On-demand verification

Users or governance can request immediate verification of specific workflow executions when disputes arise or for compliance requirements.

## Dispute resolution

When a verifier detects a deviation between expected and actual execution results:

```
┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│   Verifier      │     │   Arbitration   │     │   Governance    │
│   Node          │────▶│   Contract      │────▶│   Decision      │
└─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘
        │                       │                       │
        │  Files dispute        │  Evaluates evidence   │  Slashing or
        │  with proof           │  from both parties    │  exoneration
        ▼                       ▼                       ▼
```

### Dispute process

1. **Evidence submission**: Verifier submits the discrepancy with cryptographic proof
2. **Executor response**: The accused executor can submit counter-evidence
3. **Arbitration**: The arbitration contract evaluates both submissions
4. **Resolution**: Governance enforces the decision (slashing or exoneration)

### Slashing mechanism

Executor nodes found to have deviated from user intent face penalties:

| Violation severity | Consequence |
|--------------------|-------------|
| **Minor deviation** | Warning and reputation penalty |
| **Significant deviation** | Partial stake slashing |
| **Malicious behavior** | Full stake slashing and blacklisting |

## Verifier node requirements

| Requirement | Specification |
|-------------|---------------|
| **Independence** | Must operate separately from execution nodes |
| **Registration** | Governance approval via Kalp Network |
| **Stake** | Minimum stake required for participation |
| **Availability** | Must respond to verification requests within SLA |
| **Computation** | Capable of running KVM for workflow re-computation |

## Security guarantees

Verifier nodes provide several security guarantees to the KWALA network:

- **Non-repudiation**: Users cannot deny their signed intents
- **Execution fidelity**: Executors cannot deviate from defined workflows
- **Transparency**: All verifications are recorded on-chain
- **Accountability**: Malicious actors face economic penalties
