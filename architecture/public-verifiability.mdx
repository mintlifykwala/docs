description: 'Understanding public verifiability in Kwala'
---

Public verifiability is a core principle of the Kwala network. All core activity logs and proofs are stored immutably on the Kalp Chain, which enables complete transparency and auditability of workflow executions.

Kwala ensures that every workflow execution can be independently verified by anyone. This transparency creates trust without requiring users to rely on any single party, including Kwala itself.

## Verifiability features

| Feature | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| **Intent hashing** | Each user's workflow intent is hashed and logged with their signature |
| **Execution logs** | Actions, inputs, results, and metadata are logged in Merkle-tree-based structures |
| **Verifier reports** | Verifier nodes post zero-knowledge proofs or full logs to validate action correctness |
| **Auditability** | Any third party or regulator can replay and verify historical workflow executions |

## Intent hashing

When a user submits a workflow, the complete YAML definition is cryptographically hashed and stored on Kalp Chain alongside the user's signature.

This creates a non-repudiable record that:

- Proves the user authorized the specific workflow
- Cannot be altered after submission
- Serves as the reference for all verification

## Execution logs

All workflow executions generate detailed logs stored in Merkle-tree-based structures on Kalp Chain. The logged data includes:

| Data type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Trigger data** | The event or condition that activated the workflow |
| **Input parameters** | All values passed to workflow actions |
| **Action results** | Outputs and return values from each action |
| **State transitions** | Changes to on-chain state caused by the workflow |
| **Timestamps** | Precise timing of each execution step |
| **Node identity** | Which execution node processed the workflow |

## Verifier reports

Verifier nodes submit reports to Kalp Chain that attest to execution correctness. The reports can be zero-knowledge prrofs that verify execution without revealing sensitive data or full logs to validate workflow computation.

Each verifier report includes:

- Reference to the original intent hash
- Execution proof from the executor node
- Verifier's independent computation result
- Attestation or dispute status
- Verifier node signature

## Auditability

Any third party or regulator can replay and verify historical workflow executions using the public records on Kalp Chain. The audit process is as follows:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Retrieve intent">
    Fetch the original workflow definition and user signature from Kalp Chain using the intent hash.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Retrieve execution logs">
    Download the Merkle-proofed execution logs for the specific workflow execution.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Replay execution">
    Using the logged trigger data and inputs, independently re-execute the workflow logic.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Compare results">
    Verify that the replayed execution matches the logged results and verifier attestations.
  </Step>
</Steps>

The audit data can be used in several scenarios, including: 

| Use case | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Regulatory compliance** | Demonstrate automated actions followed approved policies |
| **Dispute resolution** | Provide evidence in case of contested transactions |
| **Security audits** | Verify no unauthorized actions were executed |
| **Operational review** | Analyze workflow performance and behavior |

## Benefits of public verifiability

**For users**

- **Transparency**: See exactly what actions were taken on your behalf
- **Accountability**: Hold execution nodes responsible for their actions
- **Trust**: Verify without relying on any single party

**For enterprises**

- **Compliance**: Meet regulatory requirements for audit trails
- **Risk management**: Independently verify automated operations
- **Due diligence**: Audit third-party workflow providers

**For the network**

- **Integrity**: Ensure all participants follow the rules
- **Decentralization**: Remove reliance on trusted intermediaries
- **Security**: Detect and penalize malicious behavior

## Accessing verification data

You can access verification data by using the Kwala explorer or directly accessing the Kalp chain.

**Kwala Explorer**

The [Kwala Explorer](https://kwala-explorer.lovable.app/) provides a user-friendly interface where you can:

- View workflow execution history
- Inspect execution logs and proofs
- Verify specific transactions
- Download audit reports

**Kalp Chain**

Developers can query Kalp Chain directly to:

- Retrieve raw execution proofs
- Verify Merkle proofs programmatically
- Build custom audit tools
- Integrate verification into applications
