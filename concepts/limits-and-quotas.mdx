Kwala provides a flexible pay-as-you-go model, allowing you to pay only for the resources you consume. This approach scales with your needs—from early-stage projects to enterprise automation.

## Pay-as-you-go pricing

Kwala uses a credit-based system where you purchase credits and consume them based on actual usage. There are no fixed monthly subscriptions, you only pay for what you use.
