description: 'Run actions automatically when token price prices hit specific thresholds'
---

Kwala monitors oracle price feeds and triggers workflows when token prices meet specified thresholds. These triggers let you define price conditions in YAML and Kwala will automatically execute your actions when the conditions are met. Price triggers are key to automations such as:

- **Price alerts**: Get notified when tokens hit target prices
- **Auto-rebalancing**: Adjust portfolio allocations based on price movements
- **Stop-loss protection**: Automatically exit positions when prices drop below thresholds
- **DeFi automation**: Execute swaps, transfers, or contract calls at specific price points

## How it works

Token price triggers monitor oracle price feeds and execute your workflow when conditions are met:

1. Kwala monitors the specified oracle feed for your target asset
2. When the price crosses your threshold, the workflow triggers
3. Your configured actions execute automatically

## Use cases
