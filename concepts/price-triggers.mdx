description: 'Run actions automatically when tokens cross price thresholds, on any supported oracle'
---

Kwala monitors oracle price feeds and triggers your workflows when token prices cross specified thresholds. Define your price conditions in YAML and Kwala executes your actions automatically.

## What you can do

- **Price alerts**: Get notified when tokens hit target prices
- **Auto-rebalancing**: Adjust portfolio allocations based on price movements
- **Stop-loss protection**: Automatically exit positions when prices drop below thresholds
- **DeFi automation**: Execute swaps, transfers, or contract calls at specific price points

## How it works

Price triggers monitor oracle price feeds and execute your workflow when conditions are met:

1. Kwala monitors the specified oracle feed for your target asset
2. When the price crosses your threshold, the workflow triggers
3. Your configured actions execute automatically
