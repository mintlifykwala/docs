Kwala provisions ERC-4337 smart wallets for your users without requiring you to handle private keys or manage wallet infrastructure. Users retain full custody of their wallets while Kwala acts as the bundler and operator.

## Key features

- **No private keys**: Kwala never stores private keys, data, or signing material
- **True self-custody**: Users control their own ERC-4337 smart wallets
- **Cryptographic verification**: All triggers are validated on-chain by the smart wallet's contract logic
- **Fully stateless**: Enterprise-grade architecture with no stored secrets

## Coming soon

Detailed configuration documentation is coming soon.
