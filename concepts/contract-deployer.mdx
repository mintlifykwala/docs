description: 'Deploy smart contracts across multiple chains from a single automated workflow'
---

Kwala lets you deploy smart contracts to any supported chain from a single workflow. You only provide the target chain ID and upload the smart contract '.sol` file or paste your Solidity contract code, which can be used to extract the complied bytecode and contract ABI. Kwala will then handle the deployment for you. 

You use the **deploy** action type to deploy a new smart contract to a blockchain network. You can also use deploy actions to deploy [Kwala Functions](/concepts/functions), which enable custom on-chain decision logic.

The following example deploys an NFT contract to Ethereum mainnet with constructor parameters for name, symbol, and initial supply:

```yaml
actions:
  - name: "Deploy NFT Contract"
    type: "deploy"
    bytecode: "0x60806040523480156200001157600080fd5b50..."
    encodedABI: "0x..."
    initializationArgs:
      - "MyNFT"
      - "NFT"
      - "1000"
    chainID: 1
    metadata: "NFT deployment on Ethereum mainnet"
    retriesUntilSuccess: 3
```

## Required fields

The following fields are required to deploy a smart contract using Kwala:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **name** | Unique identifier for this action |
| **type** | Must be `"deploy"` |
| **bytecode** | The compiled contract bytecode (hex string) |
| **encodedABI** | ABI-encoded constructor parameters |
| **initializationArgs** | Array of constructor arguments |
| **chainID** | Target blockchain network ID |


When using the visual workflow builder to deploy your smart contract, upload your `.sol` file or paste Solidity code directly, and the bytecode and ABI are auto-populated. See [Configure a workflow](/workflow-builder/configure-workflow) for step-by-step instructions.
