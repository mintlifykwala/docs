description: 'Call any Web2 API directly from your blockchain workflows'
---

Kwala lets you call REST APIs, trigger webhooks, and invoke cloud functions directly from your workflows. You can also combine on-chain triggers with off-chain actions to connect blockchain events to external services though:

- **REST APIs**: Call any HTTP endpoint with custom payloads
- **Webhooks**: Trigger external services when blockchain events occur
- **Database queries**: Connect to external data sources
- **Cloud functions**: Invoke serverless functions on AWS, GCP, or Azure
- **External services**: Integrate with any service exposing an API

## Configuration

API actions use `Type: post` to make HTTP requests:

```yaml
Actions:
  - Name: Send_notification
    Type: post
    APIEndpoint: https://api.example.com/notify
    APIPayload:
      message: "Workflow executed successfully"
    RetriesUntilSuccess: 5
```

## Configuration fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Name** | Required | Unique identifier for this action |
| **Type** | Required | Set to `post` for HTTP requests |
| **APIEndpoint** | Required | The URL to send the request to |
| **APIPayload** | Optional | JSON payload for the request body |
| **Metadata** | Optional | Description of the API call |
| **RetriesUntilSuccess** | Optional | Retry attempts on failure |

## Common integrations

### Telegram notifications

You can use Kwala to send messages to Telegram chats or channels. The [Telegram notification automation](/use-cases/telegram-notification-automation) use case shows this integration in detail:

```yaml
Actions:
  - Name: Telegram_notification
    Type: post
    APIEndpoint: https://api.telegram.org/bot<BOT_TOKEN>/sendMessage
    APIPayload:
      chat_id: YOUR_CHAT_ID
      text: "Hi! You have a new notification."
    RetriesUntilSuccess: 5
```

### Discord webhooks

Kwala supports Discord webhooks that enable sending messages to Discord channels. The following example from the [Cryptocurrency deposit alerts](/use-cases/cryptocurrency-deposit-alerts) use case demonstrates it:

```yaml
Actions:
  - Name: discord_call
    Type: post
    APIEndpoint: https://discord.com/api/webhooks/<WEBHOOK_ID>/<WEBHOOK_TOKEN>
    APIPayload:
      content: "USDC Received on USDC Treasury Vault Smart Contract"
    RetriesUntilSuccess: 5
```

### Custom webhooks

The following example shows how you can trigger any webhook endpoint with dynamic event data:

```yaml
Actions:
  - Name: Trigger_webhook
    Type: post
    APIEndpoint: https://your-service.com/webhook
    APIPayload:
      event: "transfer"
      from: "re.event(0)"
      to: "re.event(1)"
      amount: "re.event(2)"
    RetriesUntilSuccess: 5
```
To include blockchain data in your API payloads, use the `re.event()` syntax:

```yaml
APIPayload:
  sender: "re.event(0)"    # First event parameter
  receiver: "re.event(1)"  # Second event parameter
  amount: "re.event(2)"    # Third event parameter
```

The index maps to the position of values in the event data. For address tracking workflows, `re.event(0)` returns the full transaction receipt which you can parse in your backend. For more details on dynamic data extraction, see [Functions](/concepts/functions).
