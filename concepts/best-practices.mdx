Getting your workflows right the first time saves you credits and time spent debugging and fixing issues. This guide covers practical tips for building workflows that work well in production.

## Validate YAML formatting

Always validate your YAML for proper indentation and formatting before deploying. YAML is whitespace-sensitive, and incorrect indentation can cause parsing errors or unexpected behavior. Some common YAML issues to look for include: 

- Use consistent indentation (two spaces recommended)
- Check for inconsistent list formatting
- Validate your workflow using the **Compile** button before saving
- Check the **Validation** pane for real-time syntax and schema validation
- Review **Console Logs** for detailed error messages

## Test before deployment

Always test your workflows using the KWALA Workflow Builder and compile feature before deploying to the network. Once deployed, workflows cannot be edited. Some testing recommendations for your workflow include:

- Use the **Compile** button to validate schema and syntax
- Review the generated YAML in the Workflow Editor
- Verify trigger conditions are correctly configured
- Confirm action parameters are accurate
- Test with smaller values or test networks when possible

<Warning>
  Deployed workflows cannot be modified. Always verify your configuration before deployment to avoid creating unnecessary workflows.

## Choose the right execution mode

Select the appropriate execution mode based on your workflow requirements:

**Use parallel execution when:**

- Actions are independent of each other
- Speed is a priority
- Actions don't rely on outputs from previous actions
- You're sending notifications to multiple channels simultaneously

**Use sequential execution when:**

- Later actions depend on results from earlier actions
- You need to maintain a specific order of operations
- One action must complete before the next begins
- You're building multi-step transaction flows


## Combine Web2 and Web3 actions

KWALA supports both on-chain and off-chain operations in a single workflow. Use this capability to build comprehensive automation that bridges blockchain and traditional enterprise systems.

**Example use cases:**

- Monitor on-chain events and send notifications via webhook
- Trigger smart contract calls based on external API data
- Log blockchain transactions to external databases
- Integrate with messaging services like Discord or Telegram

## Secure sensitive data

Never hardcode API secrets, private keys, or sensitive credentials in your workflow definitions. Workflows are signed and stored on-chain, so your secrets may be readable. When dealing with sensitive data: 

- Use secure webhook endpoints that handle authentication server-side
- Avoid including API keys directly in workflow payloads
- Use the **Action Status Notification API Key** field for authenticated callbacks
- Keep notification endpoints behind authentication layers

<Warning>
  Workflow definitions are stored on-chain and are publicly visible. Never include private keys, API secrets, or sensitive credentials in your YAML.
</Warning>

## Set appropriate expiry dates

Configure expiry dates for your workflows to prevent unnecessary credit consumption and ensure workflows don't run indefinitely. Setting appropriate expiration dates prevents runaway costs: 

- Set realistic expiry dates based on your use case
- Update expiry dates for workflows no longer in use
- Monitor active workflows regularly
- Deactivate workflows that are no longer needed

## Use descriptive naming

Use clear, descriptive names for your workflows and actions to make monitoring and debugging easier.

- Use meaningful workflow names that describe their purpose
- Name actions based on what they do (for example, `transfer_funds`, `send_alert`)
- Include context in names when helpful (for example, `eth_price_monitor`)

## Configure retry logic

Set appropriate retry values for actions that may fail due to network issues or temporary conditions. Some tips when setting the retry logic are: 

- Use the **Retries Until Success** field for critical actions
- Consider the nature of the action when setting retry counts
- Higher retries for network-dependent operations
- Lower retries for actions that are unlikely to succeed on retry
