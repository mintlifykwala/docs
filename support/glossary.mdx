description: 'Key terms and concepts around the Kwala protocol'
---

This glossary provides definitions for key terms and concepts used throughout the Kwala platform and documentation.

## Core terms

### Workflow
A sequence of tasks automated via YAML scripts. Workflows define the actions to be executed and the conditions that trigger them, enabling automated blockchain interactions and off-chain operations.

### Kwala Virtual Machine (KVM)
The Kwala Virtual Machine (KVM) is the execution engine that interprets and processes workflow definitions. It functions as a deterministic runtime environment where YAML-based workflows are parsed, validated, and prepared for execution across the decentralized network.

### Trigger
Event, time, or price condition that activates a workflow. Triggers can be blockchain events (like token transfers), time-based schedules (cron jobs), or custom conditions that determine when your workflow should execute.

### Orchestrator
Component managing workflow lifecycle and retries. The orchestrator coordinates workflow execution, handles failures, manages retry logic, and ensures reliable execution across the Kwala network.

### Credit system
Usage-based payment mechanism for executions. Kwala uses credits as the payment unit for workflow executions, with costs determined by computational resources, gas fees, and complexity.

## Blockchain terms

### Smart contract
Self-executing code deployed on a blockchain that automatically enforces predefined rules and conditions without intermediaries.

### ABI (Application Binary Interface)
Standard interface for interacting with smart contracts, defining function signatures, parameters, and return types.

### Gas
Transaction fee paid for executing operations on blockchain networks, measured in the native cryptocurrency of each chain.

### Chain ID
Unique identifier for blockchain networks, used to distinguish between mainnet, testnet, and different blockchain ecosystems.

### EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine)
Runtime environment for executing smart contracts on Ethereum and EVM-compatible blockchains.

## Kwala-specific terms

### Kwala address
Unique identifier derived from your KALP Wallet address, following the format: `KWL-{YourKalpAddress}-CC`. This address is used for credit management and workflow execution.

### KALP Wallet
Primary wallet integration for Kwala, used for authentication, credit purchases, and managing your Kwala address.

### Action
Individual step within a workflow that performs a specific task, such as deploying a contract, calling a function, or making an API request.

### Execution mode
Determines how actions in a workflow are processed: either `parallel` (all actions run simultaneously) or `sequential` (actions run one after another).

### Block triggers
Execution credits allocated for blockchain event monitoring, included with your Kwala credit purchases.

### Verifier nodes
Network nodes that validate and verify workflow executions, ensuring transparency and correctness of automated tasks.

## Workflow components

### Event filter
Criteria used to filter blockchain events, often using regex patterns to match specific transaction parameters or addresses.

### Bytecode
Compiled smart contract code in hexadecimal format, required when deploying new contracts through workflows.

### Encoded ABI
ABI-encoded function call data used to interact with smart contracts, specifying the function and its parameters.

### Target contract
Address of an existing smart contract that a workflow action will interact with.

### API endpoint
URL of an external service that a workflow can call to fetch data or trigger external operations.

## Payment and billing

### USDT
Stablecoin (Tether) used for purchasing Kwala credits on BNB Smart Chain.

### Wallet swap
Direct method of exchanging USDT for Kwala credits from your connected wallet.

### Easy transfer
Payment method allowing you to purchase Kwala credits for a specified recipient address.

### Exchange rate
Current conversion rate between USDT and Kwala credits (For example, 49 USDT = 20 Kwala credits).

## Network and infrastructure

### BNB Smart Chain (BSC)
Blockchain network where Kwala credit transactions are processed.

### Public verifiability
Feature allowing anyone to verify workflow execution results and ensuring transparency in the Kwala network.

### Workflow execution flow
The complete lifecycle of a workflow from trigger activation through action execution to completion and verification.

## Development terms

### YAML
Human-readable data serialization language used to define Kwala workflows.

### Regex (Regular expressions)
Pattern-matching syntax used in workflows to filter events and validate data.

### Template
Pre-built workflow configuration that can be customized for specific use cases.

### Reusable component
Modular workflow element that can be shared and reused across multiple workflows (coming soon).
