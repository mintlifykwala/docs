title: "What is Kwala?"
description: "Introducing Kwala, the accessibility layer for blockchains"
---

Kwala is a decentralized automation network designed to make blockchains usable, programmable, and accessible for developers and enterprises. It provides the missing infrastructure layer that transforms passive blockchain state changes into active, automated workflows.

Kwala transforms blockchain activity into triggers, workflows, and actions, acting as a decentralized backend for Web3. When an event occurs on-chain, Kwala can execute conditional logic, orchestrate cross-chain operations, and integrate with Web2 systems. Users write workflows in YAML, which are then deployed and executed across distributed Kwala nodes. Each node runs a Kwala Virtual Machine (KVM) that securely processes trigger-based actions, both on-chain and off-chain.

## How Kwala works

Kwala is a workflow automation protocol that serves as:

- A **stateless decentralized automation protocol** that operates without servers or centralized infrastructure.
- A **no-code YAML-driven workflow engine** that makes blockchain automation accessible to any developer and enterprise.
- An **accessibility and abstraction layer** that works across multiple blockchain networks.
