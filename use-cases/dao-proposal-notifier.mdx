The DAO Proposal Notifier template helps you stay updated on DAO governance activities and never miss important votes. This guide walks you through using the template to create a workflow that monitors proposal creation events and sends instant notifications when new proposals are submitted.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- A Web3 wallet such as MetaMask connected on your Kwala dashboard
- Kwala credits in your account
- The DAO governance contract address you want to monitor
- A webhook endpoint for receiving notifications (Discord, Telegram, Slack, or custom)
- Basic understanding of the DAO governance processes

## Use cases

This template is ideal for the following scenarios:

- Monitoring new DAO proposals in real-time
- Getting alerts when voting periods begin
- Tracking governance activity across multiple DAOs
- Receiving notifications about proposal state changes
- Logging governance events to external systems for historical analysis
- Ensuring you never miss important events that affect your DAO membership

## Step 1: Access the template

1. Navigate to the [Kwala dashboard](https://app.kwala.network/dashboard) and select **My workflows**
2. Select **Templates** from the navigation menu
3. Find and select **DAO Proposal Notifier**
4. Select **View Details** to open the template

## Step 2: Provide a workflow name

In the template overview, select **Deploy Template** or **Edit Template** to open it in the Workflow Editor.

On the YAML editor, give your workflow a descriptive name: 

```yaml
Name: dao_proposal_notifier
```

When you update the name in the YAML editor, it also reflects in the workflow information pane.

## Step 3: Configure triggers

The template is pre-configured with event-based triggers that you can customize:

**Execute after**

Set to `event` to trigger when a new proposal is created:

```yaml
Trigger:
  ExecuteAfter: event
```

**Repeat after**

Set to `event` to repeat every time a new proposal event occurs:

```yaml
  RepeatEvery: event
```

**Contract monitoring**

Update the contract address and chain ID to match the DAO governance contract you want to monitor:

```yaml
  TriggerChainID: 1  # 1 for Ethereum mainnet
  TriggerSourceContract: 0x0f51bb10119727a7e5ea3538074fb341f56b09ad
  TriggerEventName: Transfer(address,address,uint256)
```

<Note>
  The template uses a `Transfer` event as an example. For DAO governance, you'll typically want to monitor events like `ProposalCreated`, `VoteCast`, `ProposalQueued`, or `ProposalExecuted`. Update the `TriggerEventName` to match your DAO's governance contract events.
</Note>

**Common DAO governance events:**

- `ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)` - New proposal submitted
- `VoteCast(address,uint256,uint8,uint256,string)` - Vote cast on a proposal
- `ProposalQueued(uint256,uint256)` - Proposal queued for execution
- `ProposalExecuted(uint256)` - Proposal executed
- `ProposalCanceled(uint256)` - Proposal canceled

**ABI configuration**

The template includes a base64-encoded ABI. You can replace this by:

1. Uploading your DAO's governance contract `.sol` file in the Workflow Builder
2. Pasting the contract ABI directly

```yaml
  TriggerSourceContractABI: W3siY29uc3RhbnQiOnRydWUsImlucHV0cyI6W10sIm5hbWUiOiJuYW1lIi...
```

**Expiry date**

Set when the workflow should stop monitoring:

```yaml
  ExpiresIn: 1781796603  # Unix timestamp
```

## Step 4: Configure recurring triggers

For repeated execution, configure the recurring source to monitor continuously:

```yaml
  RecurringChainID: 1
  RecurringSourceContract: 0x0f51bb10119727a7e5ea3538074fb341f56b09ad
  RecurringEventName: Transfer(address,address,uint256)
  RecurringEventFilter: NA
  RecurringSourceContractABI: W3siY29uc3RhbnQiOnRydWUsImlucHV0cyI6W10sIm5hbWUiOiJuYW1lIi...
```

## Step 5: Configure notification actions

The template includes a notification action that you can customize:

**Proposal notification**

This action sends an alert when a new proposal is detected:

```yaml
Actions:
  - Name: action_notify
    Type: post
    APIEndpoint: https://workflow-notification-test.kalp.network/push_notification
    APIPayload:
      message: DAO notification
    RetriesUntilSuccess: 5
```

**Customization options:**

- `APIEndpoint`: Replace with your webhook URL (Discord, Telegram, Slack, or custom endpoint)
- `message`: Customize the notification message
- `RetriesUntilSuccess`: Number of retry attempts if the notification fails

You can enhance the notification with more details about the proposal:

```yaml
  - Name: action_notify
    Type: post
    APIEndpoint: https://discord.com/api/webhooks/your-webhook-id
    APIPayload:
      content: "🗳️ New DAO Proposal Created!"
      embeds:
        - title: "Proposal Alert"
          description: "A new governance proposal has been submitted"
          fields:
            - name: "DAO"
              value: "Your DAO Name"
            - name: "Chain"
              value: "Ethereum Mainnet"
            - name: "Action Required"
              value: "Review and vote on this proposal"
          color: 3447003
    RetriesUntilSuccess: 5
```

## Step 6: Set execution mode

The template uses parallel execution, allowing multiple actions to run simultaneously:

```yaml
Execution:
  Mode: parallel
```

You can change this to `sequential` if you want actions to execute one after another.

## Step 7: Add notification settings (optional)

Configure status notifications to receive updates about workflow execution:

```yaml
Trigger:
  ActionStatusNotificationPOSTURL: https://workflow-notification-test.kalp.network/push_notification
  ActionStatusNotificationAPIKey: NA
```

### Add more actions

You can extend the template to include additional actions like sending multiple notifications or logging to databases:

**Example: Telegram notification**

```yaml
- Name: action_telegram
  Type: post
  APIEndpoint: https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/sendMessage
  APIPayload:
    chat_id: "YOUR_CHAT_ID"
    text: "New DAO proposal detected! Check your governance dashboard."
  RetriesUntilSuccess: 3
```

**Example: Slack notification**

```yaml
- Name: action_slack
  Type: post
  APIEndpoint: https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/WEBHOOK/URL
  APIPayload:
    text: "New DAO Proposal Alert"
    blocks:
      - type: "section"
        text:
          type: "mrkdwn"
          text: "*New Governance Proposal*\nA new proposal has been submitted to the DAO"
  RetriesUntilSuccess: 3
```

**Example: Log to database**

```yaml
- Name: action_log
  Type: post
  APIEndpoint: https://your-api.com/log-proposal
  APIPayload:
    eventType: "proposal_created"
    timestamp: "{{timestamp}}"
    chainId: 1
    contractAddress: "0x0f51bb10119727a7e5ea3538074fb341f56b09ad"
  RetriesUntilSuccess: 2
```

## Step 8: Compile and validate

Before deploying:

1. Select **Compile** to validate your configuration
2. Check the **Console Logs** for any errors
3. Review the **Validation** pane for real-time feedback

## Step 9: Deploy and activate

Once your workflow is configured:

1. Select **Save Workflow**
2. Approve the transaction in your wallet
3. Select **Deploy** to submit to the Kwala network
4. Select **Activate** to start monitoring DAO proposals

## Complete workflow example

Here's the complete YAML for reference:

```yaml
Name: dao_proposal_notifier
Trigger:
  TriggerSourceContract: 0x0f51bb10119727a7e5ea3538074fb341f56b09ad
  TriggerChainID: 1
  TriggerEventName: Transfer(address,address,uint256)
  TriggerEventFilter: NA
  TriggerSourceContractABI: W3siY29uc3RhbnQiOnRydWUsImlucHV0cyI6W10sIm5hbWUiOiJuYW1lIi...
  TriggerPrice: NA
  RecurringSourceContract: 0x0f51bb10119727a7e5ea3538074fb341f56b09ad
  RecurringChainID: 1
  RecurringEventName: Transfer(address,address,uint256)
  RecurringEventFilter: NA
  RecurringSourceContractABI: W3siY29uc3RhbnQiOnRydWUsImlucHV0cyI6W10sIm5hbWUiOiJuYW1lIi...
  RecurringPrice: NA
  RepeatEvery: event
  ExecuteAfter: event
  ExpiresIn: 1781796603
  Meta: NA
  ActionStatusNotificationPOSTURL: https://workflow-notification-test.kalp.network/push_notification
  ActionStatusNotificationAPIKey: NA
Actions:
  - Name: action_notify
    Type: post
    APIEndpoint: https://workflow-notification-test.kalp.network/push_notification
    APIPayload:
      message: DAO notification
    TargetContract: NA
    TargetFunction: NA
    TargetParams:
      NA
    ChainID: NA
    EncodedABI: NA
    Bytecode: NA
    Metadata: NA
    RetriesUntilSuccess: 5
Execution:
  Mode: parallel
```

## How it works

The workflow uses a **recurring event-based trigger** that continuously monitors a DAO governance contract. When the contract emits the specified event, such as a new proposal being created or a vote being cast, the workflow executes a notification action to alert you via your preferred communication channel. The parallel execution mode allows multiple notification channels to receive alerts simultaneously.
