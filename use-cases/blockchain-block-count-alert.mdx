description: 'Build an automated workflow that sends Telegram notifications when the blockchain reaches a specific block number'
---

Tracking blockchain milestones like block counts usually requires backend scripts or continuous polling systems. Those approaches can be hard to maintain and aren't ideal when you want a quick automation.

With Kwala, you can automate blockchain monitoring and real-time alerting without writing backend code. This guide shows how to create a Telegram alert that automatically triggers when the blockchain reaches a specific block number using Kwala's low-code workflow automation.

## Objective

Create a Kwala workflow that sends a Telegram alert as soon as the Polygon network reaches a defined block number. This example demonstrates how a simple YAML configuration can monitor the chain and integrate with real-world notification systems.

## Prerequisites

You'll need:

- Access to the Kwala Dashboard to create the workflow: [Kwala Dashboard](https://kwala.network/dashboard).
- A Telegram bot created through [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) for notifications.

<Tip>
Test your bot token with an API tool like ReqBin or Postman using a POST request. If the token works, it will deliver a test notification to Telegram.
</Tip>

<Note>
This use case does not require a Solidity smart contract. You only need a YAML configuration file for the workflow on Kwala.
</Note>

## Workflow setup on Kwala

Follow these steps to configure and deploy the workflow on Kwala:

### Step 1: Create a new workflow

1. Open your Kwala Dashboard.
2. Select Create Workflow.
3. In the Basic Info section, enter the workflow name, for example: `blockno4`.

### Step 2: Configure the trigger

The trigger fires when the Polygon chain reaches your target block number.

- **Execute after:** Block number, fires once the specified block is mined; for example, activates when block no. `76757000` is mined.
- **Expires in:** Defines how long the workflow remains valid, for example, `22-09-2025 13:00` in IST.
- **Trigger source configuration:**
    - **Block no:** `76,757,000` activates when block `#76757000` is mined on Polygon.
    - **Chain ID:** `137` Polygon Mainnet.
- **Action status Notification POST URL:** Add your workflow's notification URL.

<Info>
This setup ensures the workflow activates automatically when the blockchain condition is met without manual intervention or backend service required.
</Info>

### Step 3: Configure the action

When the trigger fires, the workflow will send a Telegram message.

Key settings:

- **Action name:** any name, e.g., `telegram`.
- **Action Type:** `POST request`.
- **API Endpoint:** Telegram Bot API.
- **API Payload:**

```json
{
  "chat_id": 968602918,
  "text": "Polygon has reached to the desired block number 76763500"
}
```

- **chat_id:** Telegram user or group that receives the alert, for example: `968602918`.
- **Retries Until Success:** `5` Kwala will retry up to 5 times on failure.

Once you've set these parameters, save and deploy the workflow.

## Step 4: Add the YAML configuration

Use the YAML below for your Kwala workflow. Save and compile this in the Kwala dashboard, then deploy it.

```yaml
Name: blockno4
Trigger:
  TriggerSourceContract: NA
  TriggerChainID: 137
  TriggerEventName: NA
  TriggerEventFilter: NA
  TriggerSourceContractABI: NA
  TriggerPrice: NA
  RecurringSourceContract: NA
  RecurringChainID: NA
  RecurringEventName: NA
  RecurringEventFilter: NA
  RecurringSourceContractABI: NA
  RecurringPrice: NA
  RepeatEvery: NA
  ExecuteAfter: BL76763500
  ExpiresIn: 1758547740
  Meta: NA
  ActionStatusNotificationPOSTURL: https://workflow-notification-test.kalp.network/push_notification
  ActionStatusNotificationAPIKey: NA
Actions:
  - Name: tel
    Type: post
    APIEndpoint: https://api.telegram.org/bot8424424970:AAEwOZU3XBL3pl-ufSNqCTLwkemGjO0cMbA/sendMessage
    APIPayload:
      chat_id: 968602918,
      text: "Polygon has reached to the desired block number 76763500"
    TargetContract: NA
    TargetFunction: NA
    TargetParams:
      NA
    ChainID: NA
    EncodedABI: NA
    Bytecode: NA
    Metadata: NA
    RetriesUntilSuccess: 5
Execution:
  Mode: sequential
```

### Step 5: Save and deploy

1. Save and compile the YAML workflow.
2. Deploy it.
3. Activate the workflow in Kwala and wait for its status to show **claimed**.

Once deployed, Kwala starts monitoring the blockchain. When Polygon reaches block `76,757,000`, the Telegram bot will send an instant notification.

## Output

When the workflow executes, you'll receive this Telegram alert:

> *Polygon has reached the desired block number 76,757,000*

This confirms your automation is live and working.

## Why Kwala?

Kwala Workflows let developers:

- Eliminate backend polling systems for blockchain monitoring.
- Integrate on-chain and off-chain systems using simple YAML.
- Create event-driven automations in minutes.
- Build scalable, reliable Web3 automations without heavy infra.

Whether it's notifications, API triggers, or contract interactions — Kwala makes Web3 automation simple, fast, and code-light.

## Conclusion

In this guide, you built a real-time block number alert using Kwala Workflows. The workflow sends a Telegram message when a specific block is reached, all configured via a YAML file, with no backend servers or manual checks.

Kwala bridges on-chain events and real-world systems so you can automate Web3 logic quickly and reliably.
