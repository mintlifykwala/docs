The NFT Price Tracker template helps you monitor NFT collection floor prices and receive instant notifications when prices reach your target levels. This guide walks you through using the template to create a workflow that tracks price movements and triggers alerts for buying or selling opportunities.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- A Web3 wallet such as MetaMask connected on your Kwala dashboard
- Kwala credits in your account
- Understanding of NFT marketplaces and floor price concepts
- A webhook endpoint for receiving notifications

## Use cases

This template is ideal for the following scenarios:

- Monitoring NFT collection floor prices in real-time
- Getting alerts when prices hit your buying targets
- Receiving notifications when prices reach selling thresholds
- Tracking multiple NFT collections simultaneously
- Logging price movements to external systems for historical analysis

## Step 1: Access the template

1. Navigate to the [Kwala dashboard](https://app.Kwala.network/dashboard) and select **My workflows**
2. Select **Templates** from the navigation menu
3. Find and select **NFT Price Tracker**
4. Select **View Details** to open the template

## Step 2: Provide a workflow name

In the template overview, select **Deploy Template** or **Edit Template** to open it in the Workflow Editor.

On the YAML editor, give your workflow a descriptive name: 

```yaml
Name: nft_price_tracker
```

When you update the name in the YAML editor, it also reflects in the workflow information pane.

## Step 3: Configure triggers

The template is pre-configured with oracle price triggers that you can customize:

**Execute after**

Set `oracle_price` as a trigger when the NFT floor price reaches your target:

```yaml
Trigger:
  ExecuteAfter: oracle_price
```

**Trigger price configuration**

Set the target price threshold and chain ID:

```yaml
  TriggerPrice: 738.77  # Price in ETH or native token
  TriggerChainID: 4  # Chain ID for the NFT collection
```

**Repeat after**

Set to oracle_price to repeat every time the price condition is met again:

```yaml
  RepeatEvery: oracle_price
```

**Recurring price configuration**

Configure the recurring price monitoring:

```yaml
  RecurringPrice: 738.77  # Recurring price threshold
  RecurringChainID: 4  # Chain to monitor
```

**Expiry date**

Set when the workflow should stop monitoring:

```yaml
  ExpiresIn: 1791796603  # Unix timestamp
```

## Step 4: Configure notification actions

The template includes a notification action that triggers when your price target is reached:

**Price alert notification**

This action sends an alert when the NFT floor price hits your target:

```yaml
Actions:
  - Name: Price_Reached
    Type: post
    APIEndpoint: https://workflow-notification-test.kalp.network/push_notification
    APIPayload:
      Message: Price Hit
    RetriesUntilSuccess: 5
```

Customization options:

- `APIEndpoint`: Replace with your webhook URL
- `Message`: Customize the notification message (e.g., "NFT floor price reached 2.5 ETH")
- `RetriesUntilSuccess`: Number of retry attempts if the notification fails

You can enhance the notification with more details, as shown:

```yaml
  - Name: Price_Reached
    Type: post
    APIEndpoint: https://workflow-notification-test.kalp.network/push_notification
    APIPayload:
      Message: "NFT Price Alert"
      collection: "Your Collection Name"
      targetPrice: 738.77
      currency: "ETH"
      alertType: "buy_opportunity"
    RetriesUntilSuccess: 5
```

## Step 5: Set execution mode

The template uses parallel execution, allowing multiple actions to run simultaneously:

```yaml
Execution:
  Mode: parallel
```

You can change this to sequential if you want actions to execute one after another.

## Step 6: Add notification settings (optional)

Configure status notifications to receive updates about workflow execution:

```yaml
Trigger:
  ActionStatusNotificationPOSTURL: https://workflow-notification-test.kalp.network/push_notification
  ActionStatusNotificationAPIKey: NA
```

## Step 7: Add more actions (optional)

You can extend the template to include additional actions like sending emails, updating databases, or triggering automated trades:

**Example: Email notification**

```yaml
- Name: action_email
  Type: post
  APIEndpoint: https://api.sendgrid.com/v3/mail/send
  APIPayload:
    to: "trader@example.com"
    subject: "NFT Price Alert - Target Reached"
    body: "Your target NFT floor price of 738.77 ETH has been reached"
  RetriesUntilSuccess: 3
```

**Example: Log to database**

```yaml
- Name: action_log_price
  Type: post
  APIEndpoint: https://your-api.com/log-price
  APIPayload:
    timestamp: "{{timestamp}}"
    collection: "NFT Collection"
    floorPrice: 738.77
    chainId: 4
  RetriesUntilSuccess: 2
```

## Step 8: Compile and validate

Before deploying:

1. Select **Compile** to validate your configuration
2. Check the **Console Logs** for any errors
3. Review the **Validation** pane for real-time feedback

## Step 9: Deploy and activate

Once your workflow is configured:

1. Select **Save Workflow**
2. Approve the transaction in your wallet
3. Select **Deploy** to submit to the Kwala network
4. Select **Activate** to start price monitoring

## Complete workflow example

Here's the complete YAML for reference:

```yaml
Name: nft_price_tracker
Actions:
  - APIEndpoint: https://workflow-notification-test.kalp.network/push_notification
    APIPayload:
      Message: Price Hit
    Bytecode: NA
    ChainID: NA
    EncodedABI: NA
    Metadata: NA
    Name: Price_Reached
    RetriesUntilSuccess: 5
    TargetContract: NA
    TargetFunction: NA
    TargetParams: NA
    Type: post
Execution:
  Mode: parallel
Trigger:
  ActionStatusNotificationPOSTURL: https://workflow-notification-test.kalp.network/push_notification
  ActionStatusNotificationAPIKey: NA
  ExecuteAfter: oracle_price
  ExpiresIn: 1791796603
  Meta: NA
  RecurringChainID: 4
  RecurringEventFilter: NA
  RecurringEventName: NA
  RecurringSourceContract: NA
  RecurringSourceContractABI: NA 
  RecurringPrice: 738.77
  RepeatEvery: oracle_price
  TriggerChainID: 4
  TriggerEventName: NA
  TriggerEventFilter: NA
  TriggerSourceContractABI: NA
  TriggerSourceContract: NA
  TriggerPrice: 738.77
```

## How it works

The workflow uses an oracle price trigger that continuously monitors NFT floor prices. When the floor price reaches your specified target, the workflow executes a notification action to alert you. The workflow repeats each time the price condition is met, allowing you to track both upward and downward price movements.
