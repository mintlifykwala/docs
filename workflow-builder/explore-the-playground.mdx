The [Kwala Playground](https://Kwala.network/dashboard) is your central hub for managing and testing workflows on the Kwala network. It provides an interactive environment where you can create, test, and manage your blockchain automation workflows.

## Accessing the Playground

Navigate to [Kwala.network/dashboard](https://Kwala.network/dashboard) and connect your Metamask account to access the Playground.

The Kwala Playground is divided into two main sections:

- **Kwala Bounty** - Participate in bounty programs to earn rewards (claim up to 1 Sepolia ETH)
- **My Workflows** - View and manage all your created workflows. You can create, test, debug, and execute your workflows from this pane. 

### Kwala Bounty

The Kwala Bounty program lets you complete tasks to earn rewards, claim Sepolia ETH for testing, and learn the platform by performing different tasks.

### My Workflows

This is your workflow management hub for all Kwala workflows you've created. From here, you can view workflows, access configurations, monitor execution status, and update existing workflows.

**My Workflows** pane also allows you to browse Kwala templates that you can customize for your scenario, or import an already existing YAML workflow configuration into the dashboard.
