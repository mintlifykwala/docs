After deploying and activating a workflow, you can monitor its execution status, track successful and failed actions, and review detailed execution logs from the Kwala dashboard.

## Prerequisites

- A deployed and activated workflow. See [Deploy workflow](/workflow-builder/deploy-workflow).

## View your workflows

Navigate to the [Kwala dashboard](https://app.Kwala.network/dashboard) to view all workflows associated with your account.

</Frame>

The **My Workflows** dashboard displays a cumulative overview of:

- **Successful actions**: Total number of actions that completed successfully
- **Failed actions**: Total number of actions that failed
- **Average execution time**: The average time taken to execute actions
- **Chains used**: The blockchain networks your workflows interact with

### Successful actions

Select the **Successful Actions** tab to see a detailed view of all workflow executions and their results.

</Frame>

Each record includes the following metadata:

- **Workflow**: The name of the workflow
- **Action**: The specific action that was executed
- **Timestamp**: When the action was executed
- **Execution time**: How long the action took to complete
- **Gas fees**: The gas consumed for the action
- **Chain ID**: The blockchain network where the action executed
- **Action completed**: Confirmation that the action finished successfully

### Failed actions

Expand the **Failed Actions** pane to review actions that did not complete successfully. Use this information to identify and resolve workflow issues.

### Chains used

The **Chains Used** section displays all blockchain networks your workflows have interacted with. Select this pane to view detailed on-chain activity.

## View workflow details

Select the workflow you want to monitor. The workflow information pane displays the current status of your workflow.

<Tip>
  To prevent unnecessary credit consumption by deployed workflows, update the expiry date for workflows that are no longer in use.
</Tip>

You can also use the **Console Logs** tab to monitor action execution in real-time and troubleshoot issues.

## Monitor workflows using Kwala Explorer

You can also monitor your workflows using the [Kwala Explorer](https://Kwala-explorer.lovable.app/). The Explorer provides an alternative view of your workflow activity and execution history.

To view your workflows in the Explorer:

1. Navigate to [Kwala Explorer](https://Kwala-explorer.lovable.app/)
2. Search the workflow using the workflow name or wallet address
3. View the overview of all workflows associated with your account

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/workflow-builder/monitor-workflow/explorer-wallet-address-overview.PNG" alt="Explorer wallet address overview" />
</Frame>

The overview displays:

- Total workflows deployed with your wallet address
- Total actions executed

### Recent actions

Use the **Recent Actions** pane to view detailed execution records, including:

- **Workflow ID**: Unique identifier for the workflow
- **Actions**: Specific actions that were executed
- **Chains**: Blockchain networks used
- **Gas fees**: Gas consumed during execution
- **Timestamp**: When the action was executed
- **Status**: Execution status (success, failed, pending)

Selecting a **Workflow ID** opens detailed workflow information, including trigger configuration, action history, and execution logs.
