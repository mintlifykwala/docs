This guide walks you through creating a new workflow using the KWALA Workflow Builder. The visual builder provides a form-based interface that generates YAML automatically, making it easy to configure triggers, actions, and execution settings without writing code.

## Prerequisites

Before creating a workflow, ensure you have:

- A connected Web3 wallet (MetaMask, Rainbow, Coinbase Wallet, or WalletConnect)
- KWALA credits in your account

  <Step title="Start a new workflow">
    Select **New Workflow** or **Create Your First Workflow** button on the dashboard.
