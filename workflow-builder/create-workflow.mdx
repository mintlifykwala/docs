This guide walks you through creating a new workflow using the Kwala Workflow Builder. The visual builder provides a form-based interface that generates YAML automatically, making it easy to configure triggers, actions, and execution settings without writing code.

## Prerequisites

Before creating a workflow, ensure you have:

- A connected Web3 wallet such as MetaMask
- Kwala credits in your account
- Deployed smart contracts if your workflow monitors contract events or executes contract functions

## Create a new workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Kwala dashboard">
    Navigate to the [Kwala dashboard](https://app.Kwala.network/dashboard) and sign in with your connected wallet.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start a new workflow">
    Select **New Workflow** or **Create Your First Workflow** button on the dashboard.

    A new window opens where you can visually build your workflow step by step using the form-based UI.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter workflow information">
    Start by providing basic information about your workflow:

    - **Workflow name**: Enter a descriptive name that identifies your workflow's purpose

    Select **Next** to continue.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure triggers and actions">
    Next, configure your workflow's triggers and actions:

    - **Triggers**: Define when your workflow should activate.
    - **Actions**: Specify what your workflow should do when triggered (up to 10 actions)
    - **Execution mode**: Choose sequential or parallel execution
